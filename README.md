##Different methods for retrieving information from a collection of articles in Persian
The purpose of this code is to demonstrate various techniques and methodologies for information retrieval from a collection of articles written in Persian. By employing techniques such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT embeddings, and a heuristic approach, the code aims to address the challenge of retrieving relevant information based on user queries.
These embeddings are used to encode user queries and retrieve relevant sentences from the articles. Additionally, it implements a heuristic approach to reduce searching based on average cosine similarity scores of titles, abstracts, and keywords. It serves as an educational tool to showcase how different natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to real-world tasks, specifically in the context of Persian language processing. Additionally, the code may serve as a foundation for building more sophisticated information retrieval systems tailored to Persian language datasets.
It's mentioned that the dataset used is a small manual dataset. This dataset can be replaced with a larger dataset for more comprehensive analysis and testing of the information retrieval methods demonstrated in the code.
